Dear <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_transfer_agent">MTA</a>:
<br />
<br />I'm writing to you, <a href="http://www.sendmail.org/">sendmail</a>, <a href="http://www.postfix.org/">postfix</a>, <a href="http://www.qmail.org/">qmail</a> and all other, because I need to ask you an easy thing: please, do not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_%28e-mail%29">spam</a> me! In past, I tried to contact your administrator, but it might to be impossible. Nobody answers at postmaster@yourdomain.here.com mailbox. However, a lot of MTAs in the world are sending continously a special class of spam, and their administrators know about it.
<br />
<br />What kind of Spam i'm talking about? Ok, let's see: from some months ago, you have installed an efficient antivirus for emails. Thanks to it, most computer viruses does not infect your mailboxes. However, in most cases you return virus warnings to their supposed senders. So, your administrator appears to ignore that, in most cases, senders are fake! Yes... How you can suppose I send viruses if I do not run Windows OS???
<br />
<br />So, please, dear MTA: do not answer to infected email senders. Do not disturb me! Please!
<br />
<br />I'm writiting you, MTA, because your administrator doesn't read my mails. He doesn't listen to me. He is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BOFH">BOFH</a>. Stupid BOFH!
<br />
<br />With best regards,
<br />
<br />An innocent email user.
<br />
<br /><span style="font-style: italic;">This is an open letter to all MTA's in the world.</span>
