We MUST to go them. As <a href="http://noepatents.eu.org/index.php/NO_Software_Patents">this page says</a>, <em>software developers will no longer own what they write and can be sued for selling or distributing their own software</em>. This sounds *very bad*. So, it's time to demonstrate our position again. In a few hours, there'll be some <a href="http://wiki.ffii.org/DemoPP050704Es">demonstrations in the most important spanish parties</a>.</p><p>
