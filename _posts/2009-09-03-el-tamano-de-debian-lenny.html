<p>Once again, and in collaboration with other <a href="http://libresoft.es/people/">Libresoft researchers</a>, we have finished the analysis of Lenny, the latest release of the <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux</a> distribution. As results, we have the <a href="https://penta.debconf.org/dc9_schedule/events/489.en.html">presentation of Francisco Rivas at Debconf 2009</a>, and the web interface to the database, published as usual in <a href="http://debian-counting.libresoft.es/">http://debian-counting.libresoft.es/</a>, where you can find also analysis done to previous Debian releases. We are also writing a technical report which will be published here soon. Stay tuned ;-)</p>
