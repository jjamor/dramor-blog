<p>Last weeks I have been playing with LDOMs 1.2 under Opensolaris 2009.06. I wrote <a href="http://dramor.net/blog/archives/243">some conclusions</a> here, and also <a href="http://tech.libresoft.es/doku.php/ldominstall">all the tests done</a> (both in Spanish). As part of this work, I'd like to note the, as far as I know, first <a href="http://tech.libresoft.es/doku.php/en:debianontoldom">complete procedure to install  Debian/Sparc64</a> as guest domain in LDOMs. The steps are not easy (in special, you need to play with copies of the virtual disk partition tables and any mistake can leave your virtual disk unusable), but following these steps results should be always fine. Enjoy it and do not hesitate comment here any fix or suggestion. Thanks!</p>
