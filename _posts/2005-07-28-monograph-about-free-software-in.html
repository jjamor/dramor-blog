UPGRADE is the European Journal for the Informatics Professional, published bimonthly electronically. We have written a paper published on that magazine, and <a href="http://gsyc.escet.urjc.es/~jjamor/research/papers/up6-3Amor.pdf">it is available here</a>. The paper covers our study on the source code of the <a href="http://www.debian.org/releases/sarge/">Debian 3.1</a> GNU/Linux system, one of the most popular and biggest Linux distributions in existence. In some weeks a spanish printed version will be available to <a href="http://www.ati.es/">ATI</a> members. In the meanwhile, you can <a href="http://gsyc.escet.urjc.es/~jjamor/research/papers/2005-estudio-sarge-jjamor-grex-jgb-herraiz.pdf">download here a spanish draft</a>.</p><p>
