<div style="text-align: justify;">In October 30th I'll leave my job for three years minimum. A couple of months ago I talked with <a href="http://gsyc.escet.urjc.es/%7Ejgb/">Jesus G. Barahona</a> about some Ph.D. scholarships that he offered at his university department and a few weeks later, he offered me to return to the University, converting me again in a student. From October 1th, I will be a member of GSYC (Grupo de Sistemas y Comunicaciones) of Rey Juan Carlos university. I will investigate in free software topics, with known people in this little world.
<br />
<br />To abandon my actual job was a difficult decision. It was not a very creative work, but I had very good friends there. So, to avoid missing their friendship, I will need frecuently call or write them. First, I will write them about this blog: by reading it they will remember me and they will know what I'm doing.
