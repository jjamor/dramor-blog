<p>Since I think <a href="http://http://www.google.es/services/adsense_tour/">Google Adsense</a> service doesn't work very well (read <a href="http://mnm.uib.es/gallir/posts/2005/12/23/553/">here</a> and <a href="http://blog.herraiz.org/archives/112">there</a> some samples), and now there is a campaign against censorship <a href="http://www.bloggernews.net/2006/01/blogger-news-network-discontinues.html">supported through this initiative</a>, I've also decided to remove my Googleads from my blog, <a href="http://fotos.dramor.net/">my photo album</a> and <a href="http://dramor.net/">my main web site</a>. Please, support this campaign against censhorship!</p>
